# Statistical-Analysis-on-Police-Shooting-in-USA
SAS Project
Our project aims at finding insights about the fatal police shootings in the United States of
America, which is consistently on the rise in the recent years. We spend a couple of weeks to
collect the appropriate datasets and cataloguing every fatal shooting nationwide by police
officers in the line of duty, from various databases based on news reports, public records, social
media and other sources. Each dataset is categorized by various factors including the race of the
deceased, the circumstances of the shooting, whether the person was armed and whether the
person was experiencing a mental-health crisis etc.
